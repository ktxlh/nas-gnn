# Neural Graph Embedding for Neural Architecture Search

This repository is a PyTorch implemntation of the paper [Neural Graph Embedding for Neural Architecture Search](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v34i04.5903) by Wei Li, Shaogang Gong, and Xiatian Zhu (AAAI 2020). 

To stablize the training, a weighted version of the model is also included.

## Dependencies
The code is written in Python 3.8.5. To install the dependencies, run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train a model
To run the experiments, run the command:
```
chmod +x exp.sh
./exp.sh
```
